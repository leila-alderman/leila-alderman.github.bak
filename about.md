## Welcome! 

Shifting from software engineering into application security, I recently completed the SANS Women's Immersion Academy and obtained the GWAPT, GCIH, and GSEC certifications. As a self-taught developer with a passion for life-long learning and documentation, I'm passionate about combining my drive for technical excellence with my desire to do work that matters, making the world a more secure place for users and their data.

I'm a moderator, maintainer, and top 10 contributor to the free, open-source web development curriculum [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/), which is how I taught myself to code. I'm also a top 10 contributor to Active Merchant, an open-source Ruby gem for payments processing that integrates with over 120 payment gateways.
 
My top 5 strengths from StrengthsFinder:
 - Intellection: I'm introspective and love thinking through new challenges.
 - Input: I'm constantly collecting and collating new information that I can then document for others to benefit from.
 - Learner: I'm always learning something new, whether it's teaching myself to code, learning cybersecurity, or becoming a certified Master Composter.
 - Deliberative: I like to plan ahead and develop processes to streamline work.
 - Belief: I want to do work that matters and that improves the people and world around me.
