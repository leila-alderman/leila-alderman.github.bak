# Ruby TDD Tutorial | Tic-Tac-Toe Part 2

This tutorial walks through how to write a game of [tic-tac-toe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe) that can be played in the terminal using the principles of [test-driven development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) (TDD), specifically using [RSpec](https://semaphoreci.com/community/tutorials/getting-started-with-rspec). 

[This project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/oop) is part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) curriculum, and this post follows much of the methodology in an older [tic-tac-toe game tutorial](https://codequizzes.wordpress.com/2013/10/25/creating-a-tic-tac-toe-game-with-ruby/).

The GitHub repository for this tutorial can be found [here](https://github.com/leila-alderman/tictactoe).
