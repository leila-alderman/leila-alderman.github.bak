# How to Make Colorful Ruby Terminal Games

This guide walks you through how to upgrade the games you make in the terminal to add colors and other effects.

use `system("clear")` to keep your terminal clean and to keep the game board in the same position

Although there are [several gems](https://www.ruby-toolbox.com/categories/Terminal_Coloring) that you can use to add color to your terminal game, I'm assuming here that you're just making a simple game that doesn't use any gems.

We can use [this code](https://github.com/mvndaai/ruby-toolbox/blob/master/terminal_colors.rb) in irb to test out how all of the different color combinations will look.
