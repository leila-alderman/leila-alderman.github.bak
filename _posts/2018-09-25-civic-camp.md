[Civic Camp](https://ncopenpass.com/civic-camp/) is an annual civic tech event that brings together local governments with civic hackers to improve our local communities. Friday's schedule included [keynotes and panels](https://ncopenpass.com/civic-camp/civic-camp-speakers/) in the morning and [unconference sessions](https://ncopenpass.com/blog/unconference-grid-2018/) on a wide variety of topics in the afternoon. Saturday was an all-day civic hackathon, starting with idea pitches and ending the day with judging of the project presentations. 

I joined the **NC Clear Path** team along with Melanie Mazanec, a front-end web developer for the City of Asheville, and Umesh Gupta, a computer science PhD student at NC State University. We spent all day reserching technological solutions to the accessibility problems posed by poor sidewalk infrastructure and put together a presentation on how we plan to work on solving this problem locally. 

## Accessibility History

In 2020, we will celebrate the 30th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act.  Since its signing on July 26, 1990, the time we spend in physical and digital environments designed by other people has only increased.

Cities have made strides in creating equitable experiences for everyone by building curb cuts, ramps, and other physical infrastructure.  However, steep hills, broken sidewalks, badly designed or missing curb cuts, out-of-service elevators, and poorly maintained paths still present challenges for people who use assistive technologies like wheelchairs, crutches, and canes. In America, 54.5 million people--or 1 in 6 Americans--require assistive devices or have trouble walking more than a quarter of a mile.

## Our Proposed Solution

With the proliferation of smartphones and navigation applications, it is now possible to report, map, and plan around nearly anything. Our team pitched **NC Clear Path** to help people with limited mobility more easily navigate cities by displaying different types of sidewalk obstructions. The features we hope to build include:

 - Directions tailored to a particular person’s needs based on filters for different types of sidewalk obstacles
 - Integration with 311-like systems that have APIs (SeeClickFix, for example) to include known sidewalk hazards and report issues that need to be fixed
 - Crowd-sourced updates on sidewalk conditions so that neighbors can help one another know whether obstacles have been cleared

## Similar Projects

As we researched, we found several other initiatives with similar goals: [Chi Safe Path](http://www.chisafepath.com/) in Chicago, [Google’s wheelchair-accessible pilot](https://www.blog.google/products/maps/introducing-wheelchair-accessible-routes-transit-navigation/); [AccessMap](https://www.accessmap.io/) in Seattle, which uses [Open Sidewalks](https://www.opensidewalks.com/); and [Project Sidewalk](https://sidewalk.umiacs.umd.edu/) in Washington DC. These widespread efforts toward the same goal make it clear that this is a timely and necessary idea.  We hope to integrate with and take inspiration from these projects.

## We Won!

After the project presentations and judging, our team was thrilled and honored to [win first place](http://ncopenpass.com/blog/civic-camp-hackathon-concludes-with-open-data-competition-kickoff/) at Civic Camp, and we look forward to continuing to work on this project as we gear up for [All Things Open](http://ncopenpass.com/blog/teams-are-selected-for-next-step-in-datapalooza-open-data-competition/) and [Datapalooza](http://ncopenpass.com/datapalooza/).
